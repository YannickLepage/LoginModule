{"name":"LoginModule","tagline":"This is a login module for the mini cms  you can find here : https://github.com/DL02/mycms","body":"#LoginModule\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important\r\nPlease read __entirely__ this readme and follow **carefully** the setting steps to be sure\r\neverything works fine for you. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##About this module\r\nYou'll find here, the .php and .js files to add or to replace in the original _mycms_ \r\nand  a .sql file for your database.\r\nThis module is dedicated exclusively to secure login to the administration part of \r\nthe site. Authorized users must be added directly into the database.\r\nIn this module I kind of break the mvc model of the website to avoid modifying too much file\r\nfrom the cms and to simplify installation.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Setting Steps :\r\n1. Get the mini cms from : https://github.com/DL02/mycms\r\n2. Install the database\r\n3. Clone or download all the file from this _login module_\r\n4. Add to the cms root the directory called authentification with DbAuth.php file.\r\n5. Merge my ajax directory with yours **or** add to the ajax directory the files:\r\n    * deconnexion.php \r\n    * login.js\r\n6. Merge my config directory with yours **or** replace the function.php file from your \r\ncms by mine\r\n7. Merge the view directory **or** replace your top.inc.php file situated in view-admin-\r\nlayout by mine\r\n8. Replace your admin.php file by mine.\r\n9. In php my admin or any software you use for your database, import the users.sql file \r\nin your database.  \r\n10. You can now test the login on the site with the test user:\r\n    * username: marcel\r\n    * password: marcel\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##Warning\r\nWhen you get this module it comes with the test user. **Before using this module for your website** \r\nbe sure to **delete the test user** and add a personal authorized one in your database rescpecting\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new user \r\n2. Choose a username.\r\n3. Choose a password and choose **sha1** encryption before validating.\r\n    * if you forget this, _the module won't work_ as it's _designed for sha1 encryption only_\r\n  \r\n***\r\n  \r\n##Ressources\r\nTo create this module I got help from this website : http://www.grafikart.fr/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
